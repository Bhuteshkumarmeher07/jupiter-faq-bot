    "answer": "Hey folks! Hope everyone is well. We’ve been noticing a lot of people raising service issues in the community without going through support channels first. Let’s follow a process to ease things out: If you face any issue/challenges in the app - reach out to our customer support first. We have a strong and dependable team who is ready to help you out. Here’s how you can connect with our support team: Via App chat - Open the Jupiter app > Home page, click on the ? icon > Choose your query and start chat with an agent. Email support - support@jupiter.money Call support - +91 8655055086 We won’t be able to fully address issues on the community channel unless one has formally gone through support channels. Hence, the resolution for your issue will be given to you via support channels itself. Not the community. This community is a place to learn, interact, and get constructive feedback. More importantly, co-create the product together! From, The Community Team",
